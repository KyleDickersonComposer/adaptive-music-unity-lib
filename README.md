# Adaptive Music Player for Unity3D
This is a Unity library that I plan to bundle with my bespoke music files and sell on the Unity Marketplace. The music player library will be available here under a MIT License. This music player will cover many of the same features of common music middleware products. Though, it will not have the DAW-like GUI that makes those tools so approachable to audio people (at least it won't for the time being). My focus will be on implementing the features necessary for adaptive music.

Here is a link to the [Unity3D Audio Documentation.](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/UnityEngine.AudioModule.html)


## Basics to be implemented
- Volume Envelopes and Cross-fades
- Tempo Track and Tempo Changes
- Transition Logic
- Layering Support
- Playback Logic
- Playback Hooks
- Mixer Setup

## After the basics are implemented I will try to add some more experimental features for adaptive music like:
- Smaller music blocks
- Algorithmic composition of short music blocks
- Using different grouping mechanisms than key and tempo grid (Arranging Concepts/Brantian Orchestration/Postmodern Music/Extreme Counterpoint/Crazy Pedals/Pitch Grouping/Continuous Discontinuity/Trash Beats)
